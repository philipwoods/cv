Managing CV citations with Zotero
--------------------------------------------------
1. Export my publications in BibLaTeX format as "Exported Items.bib" (the default)
2. Double click "annotate_bib.bat"
3. "Exported Items.bib" should be gone, and mypubs.bib should have appeared. This is what you will use in LaTeX.
